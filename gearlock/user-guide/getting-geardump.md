GearDump is basically a simple log collection tool to help boost the debugging process on user-reported issues. It was originally made for GearLock but now it can be helpful for the whole operating-system log collection as well.

* Press ALT+F1 or use any terminal [emulator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termoneplus)/tty.
* Run `geardump` command.
* Then you can find the **zipball** at both `/data` and at the root of your `operating-system-Partition`. You may grab it from one of these suitable locations in your favor.
